# # 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Our Task

Our task was to create a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. We had to build our codes from scratch and we also need to allow the user to submit and save there scores. As seen in the gif below we just needed to make it function in a similar way, the image below is my quiz main page.

As per the acceptance criteria, the user clicked start and the quiz started, then a timer started going down while  the user was presented with questions.

In the below images you will see my timer starting, the user losing time when they choose an incorrect answer and you will see them not losing time when a correct answer is chosen.

![Didn't Lose Time](https://github.com/Mattdsena/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/Images/same-question-no-time-lost.jpg)

Once all questions are answered or the time reaches 0, the user is offered to submit there intials so it can be saved in the high scores, as seen in the image below

They are then taken to the highscores area to see how they went against other users

Once a score and initials had been submitted the acceptance criteria had been met.

Overall I found this homework quite difficult, I initally had it going with html, css and javascript elements but after we did a class on bootstrap I decided to swap my whole project to that after I was having issues with getting the timer to work. I am quite happy I made the switch, in the following images you will see my issues and transition to bootstrap.

So overall I am happy with how it turned out but i think I still have so much to learn & I really struggle with the Javascript and constantly find myself researching to work out how to make it work
